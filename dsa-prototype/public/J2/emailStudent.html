			<p>Dear John</p>

			<p>
				Your Disability Advisor has completed an application for <strong>Disabled
					Studentsâ€™ Allowance</strong> for the academic year 2023-24. This fund
				supports disabled students and those with additional learning needs
				who may have extra costs because of their impairment.
			</p>

			<p>For your application to be submitted, you must review the details your Disability Advisor has given us and sign the declaration. You can do this online; it should only take a few minutes.</p>
			<p>Once you have signed the declaration, we will ask you which bank account you would like your allowance paid into, so please have this to hand.</p>

					application. </a> <br />
			</div>

				If you are still unsure of what to do next, please <a href="#">contact
					us</a> or speak to your Disability Advisor.
